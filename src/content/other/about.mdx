Hi !

I’m <strong>André Franco</strong>, a fullstack developer from <strong>Portugal</strong> with over
<strong>10 years of experience</strong> building scalable, user-focused applications.
My work spans both frontend and backend development, with solid expertise in technologies like
<strong>Angular, Java, Python, PHP</strong>, and <strong>Laravel</strong>.

I thrive at the intersection of clean code and purposeful design — always aiming to deliver solutions
that are both technically sound and intuitive for users.

I'm a <strong>native Portuguese speaker</strong>, fluent in <strong>professional-level English</strong>,
and I've had the privilege of working with international teams and diverse projects throughout my career.

When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me <strong>running</strong> or <strong>playing music</strong>,
two passions that keep me balanced and inspired.
