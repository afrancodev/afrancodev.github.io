Java has always been a powerful language for building robust and scalable applications. With the advent of multi-core processors, the need for efficient concurrency management has become more pronounced. Java provides several advanced concurrency tools to help developers write high-performance, concurrent applications. 

In this blog post, we will explore some of these tools, including `CompletableFuture`, `ForkJoinPool`, and `Parallel Streams`. We'll delve into their use cases, advantages, and provide code examples to illustrate their implementation.

## Introduction

Concurrency in Java allows multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously, improving the performance and responsiveness of applications. Traditional concurrency mechanisms, such as threads and synchronization, can be complex and error-prone. Fortunately, Java 8 introduced several high-level concurrency abstractions that simplify concurrent programming.

## CompletableFuture

`CompletableFuture` is a class introduced in Java 8 that provides a way to work with asynchronous programming. It represents a future result of an asynchronous computation and allows you to chain multiple asynchronous operations together.

### Key Features

1. **Asynchronous Execution**: You can execute tasks asynchronously using `supplyAsync` or `runAsync`.
2. **Chaining**: You can chain multiple asynchronous operations using methods like `thenApply`, `thenAccept`, and `thenRun`.
3. **Exception Handling**: You can handle exceptions using `exceptionally` and `handle`.

### Example

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;

public class CompletableFutureSumExample {
    private static final int THRESHOLD = 2;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        int[] array = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
        
        // Start the recursive sum computation with CompletableFuture
        CompletableFuture<Integer> futureSum = sumArray(array, 0, array.length);

        // Block and get the result (just for demonstration)
        int result = futureSum.get();
        System.out.println("Sum: " + result);
    }

    private static CompletableFuture<Integer> sumArray(int[] array, int start, int end) {
        if (end - start <= THRESHOLD) {
            // Base case: sum directly and return a completed future
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
                sum += array[i];
            }
            return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(sum);
        } else {
            // Recursive case: split the task into two subtasks
            int mid = (start + end) / 2;
            
            // Asynchronously compute left half
            CompletableFuture<Integer> leftFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
                try {
                    // Recursive call for left half
                    return sumArray(array, start, mid).get();
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    throw new RuntimeException(e);
                }
            });

            // Asynchronously compute right half (can also be done synchronously if you prefer)
            CompletableFuture<Integer> rightFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
                try {
                    return sumArray(array, mid, end).get();
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    throw new RuntimeException(e);
                }
            });

            // Combine results when both complete
            return leftFuture.thenCombine(rightFuture, Integer::sum);
        }
    }
}
```

Output
```
Sum: 55
```

Explanation of the output
1. The method **sumArray** recursively splits the array into smaller chunks.
2. If the chunk is small enough **(&lt;= THRESHOLD)**, it sums directly and returns a completed future.
3. Otherwise, it recursively creates two CompletableFuture subtasks for left and right halves using **supplyAsync**.
4. thenCombine merges the two futuresâ€™ results by summing them.
5. **futureSum.get()** waits for the entire computation to finish and returns the final sum.



## ForkJoinPool

`ForkJoinPool` is a specialized thread pool introduced in Java 7 that is designed for work-stealing algorithms. It is particularly useful for parallelizing recursive algorithms.

### Key Features

1. **Work-Stealing**: Threads in a `ForkJoinPool` can steal tasks from each other, improving load balancing.
2. **Recursive Tasks**: You can define recursive tasks using the `RecursiveTask` or `RecursiveAction` classes.
3. **Efficient Parallelism**: `ForkJoinPool` is optimized for parallelism and can significantly improve the performance of recursive algorithms.

### Example

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool;
import java.util.concurrent.RecursiveTask;

public class ForkJoinPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
        ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
        SumTask task = new SumTask(array, 0, array.length);
        int result = pool.invoke(task);
        System.out.println("Sum: " + result);
    }
}

class SumTask extends RecursiveTask<Integer> {
    private static final int THRESHOLD = 2;
    private int[] array;
    private int start;
    private int end;

    public SumTask(int[] array, int start, int end) {
        this.array = array;
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
    }

    @Override
    protected Integer compute() {
        if (end - start <= THRESHOLD) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
                sum += array[i];
            }
            return sum;
        } else {
            int mid = (start + end) / 2;
            SumTask leftTask = new SumTask(array, start, mid);
            SumTask rightTask = new SumTask(array, mid, end);
            leftTask.fork();
            int rightResult = rightTask.compute();
            int leftResult = leftTask.join();
            return leftResult + rightResult;
        }
    }
}
```
Output
```
Sum: 55
```

Explanation of the output

1. The whole array (size 10) is split into subtasks recursively until chunks of size 2 or less are reached.
2. Each chunk is summed individually.
3. The sums are combined as tasks join back up.
4. The final result is the total sum of the array elements.



## Parallel Streams

Parallel streams provide an easy way to perform parallel operations on collections. They are built on top of the `ForkJoinPool` and can significantly improve the performance of certain operations.

### Key Features

1. **Easy to Use**: Parallel streams can be created from any collection using the `parallelStream` method.
2. **Automatic Parallelism**: The framework handles the parallelism, including task splitting and load balancing.
3. **Integration with Streams API**: Parallel streams can be used with the same Stream API methods, making them easy to integrate into existing code.

### Example

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class ParallelStreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);

        // Create a parallel stream and compute the sum
        int sum = numbers.parallelStream()
                         .mapToInt(Integer::intValue)
                         .sum();

        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
    }
}
```

Output

```
Sum: 55
```


Explanation of the output

1. **numbers.parallelStream()** creates a parallel stream, which splits the list into multiple parts and processes them concurrently on multiple threads.
2. **.mapToInt(Integer::intValue)** converts each Integer to a primitive int stream, which allows efficient numeric operations.
3. **.sum()** aggregates all these integers into their total sum.

## Conclusion

By leveraging these advanced Java concurrency tools, you can significantly enhance the efficiency and responsiveness of your applications. 

Whether you're managing asynchronous tasks, parallelizing recursive algorithms, or performing parallel operations on collections, these tools offer the flexibility and performance needed to tackle complex concurrency challenges.
